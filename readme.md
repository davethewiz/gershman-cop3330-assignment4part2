<br>Created by Dave Gershman

Here's a quick guide on how to use this App, it is quite simple to pick up.

When you open the app you are greeted with a simple table to add todos.

<h3>Adding and Removing Todos </h3>
To add a todo, simply go to the bottom of the screen and type a description in the text field, then, select your due date with the date picker and press the "Add" button.

To remove a todo, simply select the row with the todo and press the "Delete Selected" button in the upper right. You can also do this if you select multiple todos by holding left control while selecting!

If you'd like to remove all todos at once, simply press the "Clear All" button also located in the upper right. Be very careful with this button, as once the todos are gone, they're gone for good.
<h3>Editing Todos </h3>
Editing todos is very simple:
- For marking a todo as complete, simply click on the empty check box and click it again to uncheck it if you are not yet done with it
- For the description simply double click on it to modify its contents
- For the Due Date, simply double click on it to open a useful Date Picker for a gregorian calendar and select your new date!

<h3>Filters </h3>
There are current 3 filter options for your todo list:
1. "All" which displays all items in your todo list
2. "Completed" which displays all completed items in your todo list
3. "Incomplete" which displays all items that are not yet completed in your todo list

<h3> Exporting and Importing </h3>

Once you are all finished with your todo list. You can press the export button and choose a directory. This will save the entire todolist as a .json file with the name "TodoList.json"


If you'd like to load that todo list to make some changes later, go ahead and press the import button and select the file location to open it.
